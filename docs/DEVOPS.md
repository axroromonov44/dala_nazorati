# DevOps runbook — Nazorat AAT

This file does two jobs:

1. **Operations manual.** When asked to "ship to test", follow
   [Release procedure](#release-procedure) — nothing else needs to be
   consulted.
2. **Infrastructure record.** What each file is for, and which invariants
   must not be broken.

> **About copied code.** The **configuration** here is complete (CI/CD YAML,
> Gradle, manifest, plists) — it is easy to lose and tedious to reconstruct.
> **Dart code is not duplicated**: only its path and its invariants are
> recorded. Keeping 800 lines in two places guarantees they drift apart, and
> at that point nobody knows which copy is right. The repository is the source
> of truth.

## Current state

| | |
|---|---|
| CI (analyze + test + build) | ✅ working, verified locally |
| Firebase project `nazorat-aat` | ✅ created, Android + iOS apps registered |
| Crashlytics | ✅ wired, config files in place |
| Diagnostics log | ✅ working |
| Remote Config update policy | ✅ parameters published |
| Push (FCM) | ✅ working, verified on a real device |
| CD — Android half | ✅ proven end to end — latest is 1.0.2+20 on the internal track |
| CD — iOS half | ⚠️ secrets complete; the IPA build is the step still failing |
| Release signing | ✅ verified locally — `flutter build appbundle --release` produces a signed 79 MB AAB |
| Branch protection on `main` | ⛔ deliberately not enabled |
| Shorebird code push | ✅ configured (`shorebird.yaml`) |

The ⚠️ row depends on [Preparing the Apple credentials](#preparing-the-apple-credentials).

## Release procedure

### What "ship to test" means

```bash
# 1. Gate, locally, before anything is pushed
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed \
  lib test packages/karantin_face_sdk/lib packages/karantin_face_sdk/test
flutter analyze --fatal-infos
(cd packages/karantin_face_sdk && flutter analyze --fatal-infos)
flutter test
(cd packages/karantin_face_sdk && flutter test)

# 2. Bump the build number, and ONLY the build number unless a new version
#    name was actually asked for. This is the default; see below.
tool/bump_build.sh           # 1.0.1+19 -> 1.0.1+20   (build only — the default)

# 3. Commit and push, then start the run by hand
git commit -am "chore: build $(grep '^version:' pubspec.yaml | sed 's/version: //')"
git push origin main
gh workflow run release.yml
```

**The build number is the only thing a test build needs.** Both stores order
releases by it and reject an upload that does not raise it; the version name is
what users read, and it changes when the release means something to them, not
once per upload.

#### Why a build-only release is dispatched, not tagged

`verify` refuses to continue when a `v*` tag does not match the version name in
`pubspec.yaml` — that catches tagging without bumping, before a 40-minute build
ends in a store rejection. But it also means a build-only bump has no tag it can
use: `1.0.1+19 -> 1.0.1+20` still wants `v1.0.1`, which already exists and
cannot be moved.

So the two paths differ, and the first one is the usual one:

| | build only | new version name |
|---|---|---|
| bump | `tool/bump_build.sh` | `tool/bump_build.sh 1.1.0` |
| start the run | `gh workflow run release.yml` | `git tag v1.1.0 && git push origin main v1.1.0` |
| tag check | skipped (no `v*` ref) | enforced |

The dispatch path is not a workaround. `release.yml` declares
`workflow_dispatch` precisely so a build can ship without inventing a version
number for it, and the tag check is written `if: startsWith(github.ref,
'refs/tags/v')` so it stays out of the way when there is no tag.

> **This has been got wrong once.** Asked for "+1 on the build", `1.0.1+19`
> went out as **`1.0.2+20`** — the version name was raised only because the
> tag path was the one written down here, and `v1.0.1` was taken. Nothing
> broke, but the store now shows a version number that stands for no change
> an inspector would notice. Reach for `gh workflow run release.yml`.

### Choosing the version name

| change | example |
|---|---|
| bug fix | `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` |
| new feature | `1.0.1` → `1.1.0` |
| breaking change or large rewrite | `1.1.0` → `2.0.0` |

The build number is independent and only ever goes up by one. A test build
that is not one of the rows above does not get a new version name — it gets a
new build number and a dispatched run.

### When only Dart changed

No need to wait for the stores — a Shorebird patch reaches devices in minutes:

```bash
shorebird patch --platforms=android,ios
```

A patch **cannot** carry changes to native code, plugins, `pubspec.yaml` or
assets. Those need a full release.

### Rolling back

Halt the internal-track release in Play Console; expire the build in
TestFlight. A Shorebird patch is undone by publishing the previous one again.

## CI — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Three jobs run in parallel on every push and pull request. The repository is
public, so even the macOS runner is free.

          channel: stable
          cache: true
      - run: flutter pub get
      - run: flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```

**Why the build jobs exist:** `flutter analyze` only reads Dart. A Gradle
plugin clash, a CocoaPods problem or missing desugaring shows up only in a
real build — which is exactly what happened in this project when
`flutter_local_notifications` turned out to need core library desugaring.

**Bump `FLUTTER_VERSION` together with the local SDK.** Otherwise CI checks
against a different one and "works on my machine" becomes possible again.

---

## CD — `.github/workflows/release.yml`

The full workflow lives in the repository. Shape: `verify` (version guard +
analyze + test) → `android` and `ios` in parallel.

### Secrets it needs

GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

| secret | what | how to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | signing key | `base64 -i android/keystore.jks \| pbcopy` |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PROPERTIES` | key passwords | `base64 -i android/key.properties \| pbcopy` |
| `ANDROID_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` | Firebase (Android) | `base64 -i android/app/google-services.json \| pbcopy` |
| `GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Play API | Google Cloud service account JSON, **plain text, not base64** — see [CD secrets](#cd-secrets) |
| `IOS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` | Firebase (iOS) | `base64 -i ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist \| pbcopy` |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12` | distribution certificate | Keychain → export .p12 → base64 |
| `IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | .p12 password | chosen during export |
| `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` | profile | Apple Developer → Profiles → base64 |
| `APPSTORE_KEY_ID` | ASC API key | App Store Connect → Users → Integrations → Keys |
| `APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID` | ASC issuer | same page |
| `APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY` | contents of the `.p8` | downloaded once, at key creation |

> **No Apple ID password is used** — two-factor auth makes it useless in CI.
> Only the App Store Connect API key (`.p8`).

`ios/ExportOptions.plist` is in the repository with `teamID = PTV6284A36`,
which must match `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` on the Runner target.

---

## Firebase

Project **`nazorat-aat`** (console:
`https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nazorat-aat`), created with the
CLI together with both apps:

| | id |
|---|---|
| Android | `1:980297703068:android:e70382e0cf0ed4aceb9759` |
| iOS | `1:980297703068:ios:03f2183c045a5bd9eb9759` |

Config files are gitignored (the repository is public). To fetch them again:

```bash
firebase apps:sdkconfig ANDROID 1:980297703068:android:e70382e0cf0ed4aceb9759 \
  --project nazorat-aat --out android/app/google-services.json
firebase apps:sdkconfig IOS 1:980297703068:ios:03f2183c045a5bd9eb9759 \
  --project nazorat-aat --out ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

> **Invariant:** `GoogleService-Info.plist` is registered in
> `project.pbxproj` under the Runner target's *Copy Bundle Resources* phase.
> Dropping the file into `ios/Runner/` is not enough — without that entry it
> never reaches the app bundle and Firebase stays dead on iOS.
>
> The flip side: because it is a declared build input, Xcode refuses to build
> at all when the file is absent. The file is gitignored, so CI would fail on
> every run. The CI job therefore writes a placeholder before building — it
> only compiles, never launches the app — while the release workflow restores
> the real file from `IOS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST`. Android solves the same
> problem differently, by applying its Gradle plugins conditionally, because
> there the plugin is what demands the file.

### Gradle plugins are conditional

`android/app/build.gradle.kts`. `google-services.json` is gitignored, so the
plugin is applied only when the file exists — otherwise CI and a fresh clone
would not build:

```kotlin
val googleServicesFile = file("google-services.json")
if (googleServicesFile.exists()) {
    apply(plugin = "com.google.gms.google-services")
    apply(plugin = "com.google.firebase.crashlytics")
} else {
    logger.lifecycle(
        "google-services.json not found - Crashlytics is disabled for this " +
            "build. Download it from the Firebase console into android/app/."
    )
}
```

The trap is that this is a log line, not an error: a release build on a machine
without the file succeeds and produces an AAB with no Crashlytics and no push.
CI is safe — it writes the file from `ANDROID_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` first — but
a hand-built AAB is only as good as what is in `android/app/`.

`android/settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.2" apply false
id("com.google.firebase.crashlytics") version "3.0.2" apply false
```

This mirrors the `hasReleaseSigning` pattern already used for signing.

---

## Observability

The problem: the app works offline, so a failure stays **on the inspector's
phone**. Three layers close that gap.

### 1. Crashlytics — crashes

`lib/core/observability/crash_reporting.dart`

- `FlutterError.onError` and `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` are wired
- collection is **off in debug** (`setCrashlyticsCollectionEnabled(!kDebugMode)`)
- `Firebase.initializeApp()` is called **without options**, inside `try/catch`

> **Do not change:** `firebase_options.dart` is deliberately unused. It would
> have to be generated for the code to compile at all, binding the whole
> project to one Firebase project. Reading the native config files instead
> means a missing file degrades to "no crash reporting" rather than "no build".

### 2. Diagnostics log — failures that are not crashes

`lib/core/observability/diagnostics_log.dart` and
`lib/core/network/diagnostics_interceptor.dart`

Crashlytics catches crashes. "I could not sign in", "the sync never
finished", "the image did not load" are not crashes. So a ring buffer is kept
on disk:

- the last **1000 lines** live in Hive and survive a restart
- every line also becomes a Crashlytics breadcrumb, so it travels with a crash
- flushed to disk when the app leaves the foreground
  (`DiagnosticsLifecycleObserver`)

What it looks like:

```
2026-10-06T14:22:08 INFO  [http] POST /auth/login 401 820ms
2026-10-06T14:23:15 ERROR [http] GET /reference/pests/ FAILED connectionTimeout 15004ms
2026-10-06T14:23:15 INFO  [sync] pests -> error
```

The first line is a wrong password, the second a dead connection. Previously
both looked like "it did not work".

> **Do not change:**
> - Response bodies are **not** logged — catalog responses run to megabytes
>   and may carry personal data.
> - Only `uri.path` is logged; a full URL may carry a token in its query.
> - The interceptor is attached **only** to `DioService` and
>   `ReferenceRemoteDataSource`. Do not attach it to the map tile or reference
>   image clients: 1255 requests would bury the log.

**How it reaches the developer:** automatically (alongside any crash or
non-fatal report), or on demand — Profile → **"Send diagnostics log"**, which
shares the file over Telegram.

### 3. Non-fatal reports

Failures that do not stop the app but are worth knowing about:

| where | what is reported |
|---|---|
| `reference_repository_impl.dart` | a catalog step failed |
| `app_download_controller.dart` | offline map download failed |
| `remote_config_service.dart` | Remote Config unavailable |
| `push_service.dart` | push service did not start |

---

## Update policy (Remote Config)

`lib/core/update/app_version.dart` · `remote_config_service.dart` ·
`update_prompt.dart`

Parameters are version-controlled in `remoteconfig.template.json` and
published with:

```bash
firebase deploy --only remoteconfig --project nazorat-aat
```

| key | example | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `min_supported_version` | `1.2.0` | below this — **forced** update, dialog cannot be dismissed |
| `latest_version` | `1.5.0` | below this — **optional**, with a "Later" button |
| `update_message` | text | replaces the built-in copy when set |
| `store_url_android` | Play link | falls back to a built-in link when empty |
| `store_url_ios` | App Store link | the button stays hidden when empty |

No new build is needed to block an old version: change the value in the
console (or the template file) and devices pick it up on their next launch
(`minimumFetchInterval` is one hour).

> **Do not change:** `resolveUpdateRequirement` returns
> `UpdateRequirement.none` for anything unparseable. Typing `v1.2.0` instead
> of `1.2.0` in the console must lock **nobody** out. `test/app_version_test.dart`
> guards this with 14 tests, including the `"1.10.0"` vs `"1.9.0"` case where
> a text comparison would place `1.10.0` lower.

---

## Push notifications (FCM)

`lib/core/notifications/push_service.dart`

All four states are handled: foreground (`onMessage` → local notification),
background (the system), terminated (`getInitialMessage`), and tapped
(`onMessageOpenedApp`).

> **Do not change:**
> - The background handler is a **top-level function** annotated with
>   `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`. Without it, tree shaking removes it from
>   release builds and background messages silently stop working.
> - The channel id `nazorat_default` appears in **three places**:
>   `PushService._channel`, the `AndroidManifest.xml` meta-data, and
>   `_showForeground`. If they disagree, nothing appears on Android 8+.

### Native configuration

`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>
...
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id"
    android:value="nazorat_default" />
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_icon"
    android:resource="@mipmap/ic_launcher" />
```

`android/app/build.gradle.kts` — required by `flutter_local_notifications`:

```kotlin
compileOptions {
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

dependencies {
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.4")
}
```

`ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`:

```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
}
application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
```

`ios/Runner/Runner.entitlements` (wired into all three build configurations
through `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS`):

```xml
<key>aps-environment</key>
<string>development</string>
```

Xcode rewrites this to `production` on App Store export, so `development` is
the correct value to keep in the file.

`ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
    <string>remote-notification</string>
</array>
```

### APNs

An APNs **authentication key** is uploaded to Firebase (Key ID `WDL4G34DNC`,
Team ID `PTV6284A36`). One key covers both development and production, never
expires, and serves every app on the account.

The "APNs Certificates" section in the Firebase console is deliberately empty:
certificates are the legacy alternative to the key, not a companion to it, and
they would have to be renewed yearly.

The Runner target carries the *Push Notifications* capability; the
`aps-environment` entitlement is wired through
`CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` in all three build configurations.

---

## Permissions

### Android

Declared in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`: internet, fine /
coarse / background location, camera, microphone, media and legacy storage
reads, and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` for Android 13+.

### iOS

`Info.plist` holds the **English** usage descriptions, which is what App
Store review reads. Inspectors still see their own language because the
strings are localized:

```
ios/Runner/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings
ios/Runner/uz.lproj/InfoPlist.strings
ios/Runner/ru.lproj/InfoPlist.strings
```

> **Do not change:** the three files form a `PBXVariantGroup` in
> `project.pbxproj` and `uz`/`ru` are listed in `knownRegions`. A language
> missing from `knownRegions` is not built at all, and a variant group missing
> from *Copy Bundle Resources* never reaches the bundle — in both cases the
> prompts silently fall back to English. Verify after changing:
> `ls build/ios/iphoneos/Runner.app/*.lproj`.

Adding a new permission means editing four files: `Info.plist` (English) plus
the three `InfoPlist.strings`.

## Where this was left off

Last updated 2026-10-07. Everything below is the state of the repository as it
actually stands, not a plan.

### Done and verified

- `main` carries the whole pipeline; CI passes there (analyze, tests, real
  Android and iOS builds).
- Firebase project `nazorat-aat` with both apps registered; Crashlytics,
  Analytics, Remote Config and FCM are wired.
- Remote Config parameters are published from `remoteconfig.template.json`.
- Push notifications were tested end to end on a real device.
- `flutter build appbundle --release` produces a signed bundle, so the signing
  configuration itself is known good.
- **The Android pipeline has run for real,** twice. `v1.0.1` shipped
  1.0.1+19 and `v1.0.2` shipped 1.0.2+20; the internal track reports both
  `completed`. Nothing on that side is theoretical any more.
- 1.0.2 should have been 1.0.1+20. The version name was raised only because
  the tag path was the one documented — see
  [What "ship to test" means](#what-ship-to-test-means), now corrected.

### Deliberately skipped

Branch protection on `main` is **not** enabled. CI runs on every push and pull
request but does not block a merge. This was a conscious choice, not an
oversight — do not "fix" it without being asked.

### CD secrets

Already set — the whole Android half, the App Store Connect API key and the
distribution certificate:

```
ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ANDROID_KEY_PROPERTIES
ANDROID_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON
GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
IOS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST
APPSTORE_KEY_ID
APPSTORE_ISSUER_ID
APPSTORE_PRIVATE_KEY
IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12
IOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD
IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE
```

The ASC key is `L2B3479S8C`. Do not confuse it with `WDL4G34DNC`, the APNs key
in Firebase: both are `AuthKey_<id>.p8` files holding an EC private key, so
only the console they came from tells them apart — an ASC key comes from
App Store Connect → Users and Access → Integrations → Keys, never from
Apple Developer → Keys. `release.yml` writes the secret to
`AuthKey_$KEY_ID.p8`, so `APPSTORE_KEY_ID` must be the id of the key the
`.p8` actually belongs to.

`GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is the `play-release-ci@nazorat-aat` service
account, created in the `nazorat-aat` Google Cloud project — a Firebase project
*is* a Cloud project, so no second one was made. It carries **no Cloud IAM
role**; the upload right comes from the Play Console invitation, not from
Cloud. The old "Play Console → Setup → API access" route no longer exists:

1. Cloud Console → enable `Google Play Android Developer API`
2. IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → create, skip the role step → Keys → JSON
3. Play Console → **Users and permissions → Invite new users** → that service
   account's email → `com.nazorat.aat.uz` → *View app information* and
   *Release to testing tracks*

The key goes in as **plain text** (`serviceAccountJsonPlainText`), unlike every
other secret here, which is base64. Access can be checked without spending a
40-minute build on it — this returns HTTP 200 once the invitation has landed:

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<key>.json
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token \
  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher)" \
  -H "Content-Length: 0" \
  https://androidpublisher.googleapis.com/androidpublisher/v3/applications/com.nazorat.aat.uz/edits
```

Nothing is missing any more. The release has still never run end to end on
the iOS side, so the first run is where the remaining problems show up.

> `gh secret set X < ~/Downloads/file` fails with `Operation not permitted`
> when it runs from an agent or a tool: macOS guards `~/Downloads` and
> `~/Desktop` per application, and moving the file between those two changes
> nothing. `~/Documents` is not guarded, so moving the file there is the
> simplest fix; otherwise run it from Terminal.app, which asks once.

### Preparing the Apple credentials

Parked on purpose — picked up in a daytime session, since every step runs
through Apple's consoles. Everything below is what that session starts from.

Two things must already exist, or the run builds an IPA and then fails on the
last step:

- `com.nazorat.aat.uz` registered under Apple Developer → **Identifiers**
- an App Store Connect app record for that same bundle id

**The certificate** — ✅ done:
`Apple Distribution: Shokhrukh Shodiev (PTV6284A36)`, valid until 2027-10-07.
How it was obtained: Keychain Access → Certificate Assistant → *Request a Certificate from a
Certificate Authority* → save the CSR. Apple Developer → Certificates → **+** →
**Apple Distribution** → upload the CSR → download the `.cer` → double-click to
install. Keychain Access → **My Certificates** → right-click the
`Apple Distribution:` entry → **Export** as `.p12`, choosing a password.

**The profile** — ✅ done: `Nazorat AAT`, UUID
`8d8aeb14-c271-47eb-9eb1-b42d5615e774`, valid until 2027-10-07. How it was
obtained: Apple Developer → **Profiles** → **+** → **App Store** (Apple now
labels it *App Store Connect*) → App ID `com.nazorat.aat.uz` → that
certificate → download the `.mobileprovision`.

A profile is worth checking before trusting it, since every way of getting it
wrong fails the same way later:

```bash
security cms -D -i Nazorat_AAT.mobileprovision > /tmp/p.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Name' /tmp/p.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :Entitlements:application-identifier' /tmp/p.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Print :ProvisionedDevices' /tmp/p.plist
```

`Name` is what `ExportOptions.plist` needs and it is not the file name — here
`Nazorat AAT` against `Nazorat_AAT.mobileprovision`. A `ProvisionedDevices`
array means an Ad Hoc profile, which cannot reach TestFlight. The certificate
embedded in the profile must be the same one the `.p12` holds; comparing SHA-1
fingerprints proves it:

```bash
python3 -c "import plistlib,hashlib;print(hashlib.sha1(plistlib.load(open('/tmp/p.plist','rb'))['DeveloperCertificates'][0]).hexdigest().upper())"
security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep Distribution
```

**The API key** — ✅ done (`L2B3479S8C`). It came from App Store Connect →
Users and Access → Integrations → **Keys**, access role **App Manager**; a
lesser role cannot upload builds. The `.p8` downloads once; both IDs are on
that page.

```bash
base64 -i ~/Downloads/dist.p12            | gh secret set IOS_CERTIFICATE_P12
base64 -i ~/Downloads/app.mobileprovision | gh secret set IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE
```

Note the asymmetry: the `.p12` and the profile go in **base64**, while the
`.p8` went in as **plain text**, because the workflow writes it straight to a
file. Base64 there builds fine and fails at upload with nothing that points at
the cause.

Verifying the `.p12` locally with Homebrew's OpenSSL 3 fails on
`RC2-40-CBC : unsupported` — Apple exports with a cipher OpenSSL 3 retired, so
either add `-legacy` or use `/usr/bin/openssl` (LibreSSL). This says nothing
about the file: CI imports it with `apple-actions/import-codesign-certs`, which
goes through macOS `security`, the same tool that wrote it.

Re-running needs no new tag — `gh workflow run release.yml` replays it.

### Signing: the archive and the export are two steps

`flutter build ipa` archives first and exports second, and **they are signed
from different places.** `ios/ExportOptions.plist` configures only the export.
The archive uses the Xcode project, so a correct `ExportOptions.plist` does
nothing for it — run 37590185220 failed with the certificate and the profile
both in place:

```
Error (Xcode): No Accounts: Add a new account in Accounts settings.
Error (Xcode): No profiles for 'com.nazorat.aat.uz' were found: Xcode couldn't
  find any iOS App Development provisioning profiles matching ...
```

Two causes, both in the project. The Runner target set no `CODE_SIGN_STYLE`,
which means automatic, and automatic signing wants an Apple ID that CI does
not have. And the project level pins
`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*] = "iPhone Developer"` — the Flutter
template's default — which is why it hunted for a *development* profile.

So the Runner target's **Release** configuration now carries:

```
CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual;
"CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY[sdk=iphoneos*]" = "Apple Distribution";
PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER = "Nazorat AAT";
```

Release only. Debug and Profile stay automatic, so `flutter run` on a device
still signs with whichever Apple ID the developer has. Checking it needs no
build:

```bash
cd ios && xcodebuild -project Runner.xcodeproj -target Runner \
  -configuration Release -showBuildSettings | grep CODE_SIGN
```

`PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER` is the profile's internal `Name`, not its
file name.

The two halves are independent: the Android job releases on its own, without
waiting for any of the Apple credentials. Until they exist the iOS job fails
while Android still reaches Play — a red run is not a broken release.

### Next steps, in order

1. **Get the iOS release past the IPA build.** Run 37590185220 reached
   `Build IPA` and failed there; the manual-signing settings that answer it
   went in afterwards and have not been through a run yet. The upload step
   beyond it is still unproven, and it needs an App Store Connect app record
   for `com.nazorat.aat.uz` — worth confirming before blaming the signing.
2. **Wire `onMessageOpened` to navigation.** The handler exists but goes
   nowhere, because which screen to open depends on what `data` the backend
   sends with a push. Needs a decision first, not code.
3. **Rotate the keystore passwords** in `android/key.properties`, then update
   `ANDROID_KEY_PROPERTIES`. Routine hygiene:
   ```bash
   keytool -storepasswd -keystore android/keystore.jks
   keytool -keypasswd -alias upload -keystore android/keystore.jks
   ```
   This changes only the passwords, not the key, so nothing breaks in Play
   Console.
4. **Backend conversations** (separate track, nothing here blocks on them):
   - Catalog images total **1.04 GB**. Thumbnails would cut that to roughly
     68 MB (WebP 1280px) or 17 MB (320px). Raise with the
     `datahub.karantin.uz` team.
   - There is no staging backend, so a clearly marked test inspector on
     production is needed — today `flutter run` writes to the real database.
   - `page_size` is ignored on `/reference/plants/`, so 184 plants cost 10
     sequential requests.

### The retired bundle id

`com.dala.nazorati.uz` is **dead**. It was the earlier id, it still had a Play
listing, and the release service account gets `403` on it — which reads like a
permissions problem and is not one. The live package is `com.nazorat.aat.uz`,
in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`, `release.yml` and the iOS target alike.

Related: SHA fingerprints come from the signing certificate, never from a
device or a package name, and under Play App Signing the certificate that
matters is Google's, not the local upload key. The one way to read the real
one without waiting for a Console page is to ask an installed build:

```bash
adb shell pm path com.nazorat.aat.uz          # then pull that base.apk
apksigner verify --print-certs base.apk
```

`CN=Android, O=Google Inc.` in the output means Play re-signed it, so those
digests are the production fingerprints. `CN=Android Debug` means the build
came from `flutter run` and its fingerprint is worth nothing to Firebase.

### Known, accepted, not a bug

Face capture sends frames **un-mirrored** (`karantin_face_scanner.dart` has no
flip) while the old webview flipped them horizontally. The flow was verified on
a device and works. If the backend ever starts rejecting face matches, this is
the first place to look.

## Keeping this file current

Update it whenever the infrastructure changes — a new workflow, a new secret,
a new observability layer. A stale runbook is worse than none, because people
trust it.
